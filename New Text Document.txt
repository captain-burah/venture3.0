In order to ensure that our tests are fair and non-discriminatory, we collect demographic information on test-takers. Submitting this information is entirely optional, and the information you enter here will not be shared with a prospective employer, other than anonymously and in aggregate form. A prospective employer will never know if you do or do not provide any of this information; it has no effect on your chances of being hired.
